# Social Media 

This is a social media platform built with **Node.js** and **EJS** as the template engine. The project includes core features similar to Instagram, such as creating posts, following/unfollowing users, liking, commenting, and saving posts.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Sign up, log in, log out, and password management.
- **Post Management**: Users can create, delete, and edit their posts with media support (images and videos).
- **Follow/Unfollow**: Follow and unfollow other users to see their posts in the feed.
- **Like and Comment**: Like posts and add comments. Both likes and comments are displayed in real-time on posts.
- **Save Posts**: Users can save posts to view them later in their profile.
- **Profile Page**: Users have their own profile page where they can view their posts, saved posts, and manage followers and following.
  
## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Backend server to handle requests and perform actions.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for building RESTful APIs.
- **MongoDB (Mongoose)**: Database to store user information, posts, likes, comments, and relationships (followers).
- **EJS (Embedded JavaScript)**: Template engine for rendering HTML with dynamic data.
- **Multer**: Middleware for handling file uploads for images and videos in posts.
